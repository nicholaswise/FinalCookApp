Project: Recipe Rescue

Introduction:

The purpose of the application is to allow users to copy and paste recipes and learn the definintions of cooking terms. This was done by using a

data base first approach using MVC and ASP.net. The coding was done using Linq, Razor, JavaScipt, JQuery, JSON, HTML,CSS and AJAX. OAuth using

Google, Facebook, and Twitter.



The AJAX scripts within the view handle passing JSON objects to be used in the controllers. The JSON objects are then used to check against the

database and return the proper data back to the View as a JSON resalt.



The jQuery fuctontions hide()/show() are used to manipulate page content.
